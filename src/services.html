            Eyelash Extensions are a high maintenance beauty treatment. They require very gentle care in order for the lashes to last longer and stay in good condition.
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don't get them wet for 48 hours after application, try to avoid washing your eyes, splashing your face, going to a pool/beach or getting your eyelash extensions wet. Water can affect the glue, causing the bond to become brittle and easy to break.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                After that, wash them regularly. After two days the first, residue may start to build up around the lash line if you don't wash your extensions. This can lead to eye infections and other eye issues. Instead, you're going to want to clean your lash extensions around every 3 days.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                You shouldn't be using any oil-based products near your eyelash extensions. So check your products before using them ‚Äî especially eye creams and makeup removers.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                You'll also want to skip mascara, even the ones that market themselves as ‚Äúextension-safe.‚Äù Waterproof makeup, such as waterproof mascara, can soften the glue on your lash extensions. If you use eyeliner, opt for a water-based, non-waterproof version ‚Äî and be gentle when you remove your makeup at the end of the night. Rubbing your eyes isn't good for your extensions. It could damage them and your real lashes. Powdery eyeshadow might not be a great idea either, as the powder can get stuck in the glue and build up over time.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Many people often suffer the tragedy of seared eyelashes. It can be very concerning. Avoid getting too close to the macaroni-pie in the oven and please avoid the steam from Shabba Mudda Pot! These may seem like very obvious issues. But, for those clients who have never had to be careful around heat, this very important to bare in mind BEFORE it happens. As you never have to worry about your natural lashes shriveling up near heat, it can slip your mind sometimes once the extensions are in.

              If you've never had eyelash extensions before we will need you to come into the salon 24-48 hours before your appointment to have a patch test done to ensure that you have no sensitivity or allergic reaction to the adhesives used for lash application. Please let us know when you make your appointment if this is the case and we will advise you regarding this.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              The safety of your eyes is of paramount importance to us therefore the patch test requirement is not negotiable. If you have had lashes applied by us before this patch test is not usually necessary but special cases may require one.

            <br>
            <li>
              If you have had lashes applied at another salon, we will need to remove these and thoroughly cleanse your lashes before application can take place and we may require you to have a patch test as well.

        <summary class="service_heading">Volume</summary>
        <p>
          Volume lashes is a technique in which multiplied lash extensions are fanned out and applied to one natural lash (one to many). Volume eyelash extensions allow for a great level of customization to achieve the client's desired look. This technique will give you a fuller and fluffier lash line.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The difference between mega volume and traditional volume is the number of false lashes used to create a fan and the diameter of these false lashes. Each mega volume fan uses 6 to 16 false lashes with diameters between 0.03 to 0.05 mm while a volume fan will use 2 to 5 false lashes with diameters between 0.05 to 0.07 mm. Mega volume allows for a denser and darker look look since it uses these light-weight fans with numerous extensions.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            There is a negative relationship between the number of lashes in a fan and the diameter. In order to keep the weight of a fan constant, if the number of lashes increases, the diameter must decrease. If the diameter increases, the number of lashes must decrease.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            But how come three 0.07 mm extensions would be equal to one 0.15 mm? Even better, how come twelve 0.03 mm extensions would be equal to one 0.15 mm?Because of negative space ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è!
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Negative space in a volume fan is the space that would otherwise be occupied by a single lash extension when comparing the volume fan to a single extension. A volume fan created from three 0.07 mm extensions creates a lot of negative space (section in gray) when compared to one single 0.15 mm extension. This explains why this volume fan is not heavier. A volume fan created from seven 0.05 mm extensions creates a lot of negative space (section in gray) when compared to one single 0.15 mm extension. This explains why this volume fan is not heavier.

      <details class="info_container">
        <summary class="service_heading">Classic</summary>
        <p>
          Classic lash extensions are a type of eyelash extensions applied on a 1:1 ratio, which means one extension is attached to one natural lash. One extension is dipped into the adhesive and applied to one of your natural lashes, unlike strip cluster lashes, which are applied to the skin of the eyelid. Classic lash extensions are also known as individual lashes or 1 to 1 lash extensions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Classic eyelashes are the most traditional and popular style because the results look natural, they are not heavy to the eye and, if done properly, they won't damage your natural lashes. They come in different materials as well as length, thickness, and curl type.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Classic lash extensions can be made of natural or synthetic materials, usually mink, sable, and fox fur, as well as silk and faux mink. The treatment usually lasts 1.5 to 2 hours. The lash tech will prepare your eyes for the treatment, and then dip each of the classic eyelash extensions in the lash adhesive individually and apply it to your natural lashes.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to come with clean lashes and the area around them, so don't wear makeup to the appointment and avoid waterproof mascara before the treatment to make sure your lashes are completely makeup-free. Also, avoid oil-based products around your eyes.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Take off your contact lenses before the appointment. It is also advisable to shower before the treatment since you shouldn't shower afterward because this can affect the lash glue. It will take some time for it to dry completely.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <details class="info_container">
        <summary class="service_heading">Hybrid</summary>
        <p>
          Hybrid lash extensions combine two styles - classic lashes and Russian volume lashes - to create a customized, more natural look. Classic lashes, where 1 lash extension is applied to 1 of your natural lashes, are added at some spots to add length to the lashes. Russian volume lashes are small fans of 2-6 attached lashes applied to 1 of the natural lashes. These are used to add more density and fullness.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            So, hybrid lashes are classic lashes (1:1) and volume lashes (2-6:1) mixed to give length and volume to sparse lashes. The result? Wispy, textured lash extension look that looks more natural than Russian volume look.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            The hybrid lash extensions treatment lasts 1.5 - 2.5 hours. As said above, the lash techs use a mix of classic lashes and volume lashes, usually 50% of one style, 50% of the other, but sometimes, the relation is 30% : 70%, depending on how thick you want your hybrid eyelashes to be. The lash tech will combine the lash extensions of various thicknesses, lengths, and curls to give you the desired look, depending on your preferences and the state of your natural lashes. You can choose whether you want a spiky hybrid set or a shorter, more natural-looking wispy set.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before you come to your hybrid lashes appointment, it is advisable to remove all traces of makeup and come with completely clean lashes. Avoid oil-based products and don't use a lash curler before the treatment.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Hybrid eyelash extensions are attached to your natural lashes, so they follow their growth cycle and fall off with them. Therefore, hybrid eyelash extensions last 6-8 weeks but expect to lose about 50% of hybrid lashes after 3-4 weeks.

        <summary class="service_heading">Wispy</summary>
        <p>
          Wispy lashes are the trendiest style because they look fluffy and feathery, so very natural. They are perfect for people who prefer a dramatic, makeup look and eyelashes that stand out. Wispy lashes can be achieved in different ways. Besides getting a strip of wispy lashes, which are one-time use, or trying to achieve the effect with mascara, the best long-term results are achieved with eyelash extensions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wispy eyelash extensions are created by combining either individual lashes or closed fans and eyelash extensions fans of different lengths and curls. That way you get feathery lashes with noticeable spikes. It is all about mapping! And if you are a lash artist, you know that it is not an easy thing to do and requires a lot of practice and hard work.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Wispy eyelashes can be created in three ways: with classic lashes of different lengths, with volume lashes as well as hybrid lashes, which are a combination of the two styles. The biggest problem is how to choose the right length and the spots where the spikes will be placed, so the lashes look even. Also, you need to figure out how much weight your client's lashes can hold and then map a design that fits their eyes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spikes are 2-3 mm longer than the main layer. They are made of closed fans (for wispy volume) or individual lashes (for wispy classics and wispy hybrid lashes). There are usually 7-10 spikes per eye. Lash technicians usually put two individual lashes or closed lash fans close to each other to make a spike, so if the client loses one extension, the other one is there to fill in the gap. Lash technicians most commonly choose individual lashes of 10mm to 20mm in length, 0.07 - 0.10 mm thickness and C, CC or D curls.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            This layer is created with 2-6D fans, also known as volume lashes. They are added to fill in the spots between the spikes and add density and thickness to the lashes. Lash technicians usually use fans that are 7mm to 14 mm long and very thin, 0.03-0.05mm, in C or D curls.
